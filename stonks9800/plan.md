## Event Mechanics

### Short Seller Reports
```
initial_crash → denial → [waiting → followup_attack → denial]* → resolution
```
- 1-3 waves typical, each follow-up increases vindication probability
- Resolution: vindicated (-15% + EPS damage) or debunked (+15-25%)

### Manipulation (Pump & Dump)
```
accumulation → catalyst → distribution → [re_accumulation → catalyst → distribution]* → crash
```
- 1-3 cycles, each wave diminishes pump effectiveness
- More waves = harder crash (retail trapped)

### Dead Cat Bounce
```
crash → [bounce → continued_decline]* → resolution
```
- 1-4 bounces, each weaker than last
- More bounces = higher chance of real bottom

- Regulatory investigations (rumor → confirmation → settlement/charges)
- Earnings revision cycles (pre-announce → miss → guidance cut → kitchen sink)
- Bankruptcy process (liquidity concerns → going concern → Chapter 11)
